## FTP-Search

#Why this Utility?
Most of the Institutions and Organisations now have their own FTP servers. They contain huge amount of files and sometimes not well arranged (Ateast, not well arranged in my institute). Thus, instead of wasting time of their users, there can be one MySQL server set up in the organisation which indexes files regularly (that is in progress for now) and users can find their required file or folder and download it within click of a button.
